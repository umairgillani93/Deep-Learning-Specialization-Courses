    "\n",
    "* One of the problems with image classification is the large number of features. For examples a 28*28 picture size has total of __784__ number of features. And for an __RGB__ image the total number of features would be __28*28*3__ i.e __2352__ \n",
    "\n",
    "* And if we have __1000*1000__ i.e __1M__ number of features in an image, the __Weight Matrix__ for first hidden layer would be __W[1] = (1000*1000*3, 1000)__ where __1000__ is the number of units in first hidden layer. And on the whole we will have __3B__ parameters to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Thats where __Convolution__ concept comes into play, that shriks down the parameters by going through a certain process. We well be covering that in detail!\n"

    "* Well in order to detect a __Vertical Edge__ we construct a __3*3__ Matrix called __Filter__, sometimes they call it a __Kernal__.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now we go ahead and apply __Convolution__ process, i.e we will map this __kernal__ on our image and get the element-wise multiplication sum of each __pixel value__ with the __filter box value__ and this will be equal to the __first pixel value__ of our new matrix\n",
