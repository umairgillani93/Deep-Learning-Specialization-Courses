    "\n",
    "* One of the problems with image classification is the large number of features. For examples a 28*28 picture size has total of __784__ number of features. And for an __RGB__ image the total number of features would be __28*28*3__ i.e __2352__ \n",

    "\n",
    "* Now we go ahead and apply __Convolution__ process, i.e we will map this __kernal__ on our image and get the element-wise multiplication sum of each __pixel value__ with the __filter box value__ and this will be equal to the __first pixel value__ of our new matrix\n",
